## Verilog Digital Designs Collection.

 📌 Project Overview:

This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Finite State Machine (FSM) design in Verilog HDL.
The controller manages traffic flow at a 4-way intersection by controlling Red, Yellow, and Green lights with proper timing sequences.

The design follows Moore FSM architecture and can be synthesized and implemented on an FPGA board (Nexys 4 DDR / Basys 3).

**Features:

Implements FSM-based Traffic Light Controller
Supports 3 traffic states per road (Red, Yellow, Green)
Configurable timing for each state
Designed for FPGA deployment (tested on Xilinx Vivado)
Behavioral Verilog modeling
